Over the last year and a half I’ve been:

- completing my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) on Feb 2nd 2026 
- working on a simple Cloud-Music-Project to further develop my skills post studies (still W.I.P.)
- contributing to a self-organized study group for daily support, sharing of knowledge & resources post studies
- learning and working hands-on with **AWS, Linux basics, containerized services and CI/CD**
- completing a **14-month full-time Software Engineering program with a focus on Cloud** (Masterschool), certificate received in Nov. 2025
- doing a **320-hours full-time DevOps/Cloud internship** (WeBeet) with real-world infrastructure and observability tasks for a mobile housing app
- bringing in experience from creative projects, organizing work, documentation and support-focused roles
